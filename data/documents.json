However, it's important to note that this flowchart does not provide any information on what happens after the approval stage.\nAdditional Information\nThe flowchart includes several boxes with brief descriptions, such as \"Director/Unit Head\", \"HRD\", and \"End\". These boxes likely represent different roles or stages in the promotion evaluation process.\nThe chart uses arrows to connect each box, indicating the flow of the process from one stage to the next.\nThere are no specific dates or deadlines mentioned in the flowchart, suggesting that the process is ongoing and may take place over an extended period.\nIn summary, the image depicts a flowchart outlining the steps involved in evaluating and approving employee promotions within an organization. The chart begins with initiation by the Director/Unit Head, followed by evaluation and approval processes, and concludes with the submission of a promotion request to HRD for final approval. While the flowchart provides a clear overview of the process, it lacks specific details on what happens after the approval stage and does not include any dates or deadlines.\nFigure 1.4.2-A\n\\Promotion Committee is recommended by Human Resource Department and/or consulted with Top Management if necessary.\nHere is a step-by-step procedure of the Promotion Process:\n<2>1. Promotion Request\nDirector/Unit Head will identify opportunities to promote one or more employees who are ready for the next step in their careers. After selecting, Director/Unit Head will inform and send the candidates list to Promotion Committee.\n<2>2. Promotion Committee\u2019s Evaluation & Approval\nEach member of the Promotion Committee will assess the candidates using Evaluation Criteria and make the final approval decision. Depending on the result of the decision, there will be two case scenarios:\n\u2022 If approved \u2013 Human Resource Department will be informed of the results and notify Director/Unit Head. Afterward, Human Resource Department will process paperwork to formalize the promotion.\n\u2022 If disapproved \u2013 Human Resource Department will be informed of the results and notify Director/Unit Head.\n<2>3. Paperwork\nHuman Resource Department will prepare the new contract appendices and inform the newly promoted employees about the changes in salary and benefits (if any)."
