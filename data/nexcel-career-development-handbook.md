## 1. Introduction
---------------
### 1.1. Purpose
*Nexcel Career Development Handbook* is the document that presents the guidelines, regulations, and procedures for advancing and promoting Nexcel employee’s career paths. The overall purpose of the career advancement/promotion process is to reward and invest in well-performed employees, and motivate them to improve their performance.
### 1.2. Nexcel Career Paths
Nexcel Career Paths encompass various progressions of all Nexcel’s occupations, ranked in a progressive order based on the level of qualifications, skills, and contributions, with two different classifications including [Professional](#professional) and [Management](#Management) Branches.
Our career paths aim to assist employees in identifying their current positions within Nexcel, and provide employees with a better understanding of what knowledge, skills, and qualifications (based on [Evaluation Criteria](#EvaluationCriteria)) required to advance to the next title, along with helping them determine their career goals and which career trajectory (Professional or Management Branch) to pursue.
With clearly defined career paths in place, employees will be exposed to more opportunities for promotion as well as expanding their career choices and orientations.
To ensure fair and consistent evaluation of employee’s capability, Nexcel employs job grading system as a standardized approach of objectively assigning value to employee’s positions within the organization. The grading system will also serve as a reference for employee’s career paths in Nexcel.
#### 1.2.1. Job Titles & Grades
Job titles (Engineer, Senior, Staff, etc.) reflect the experience, qualifications, skills, and knowledge that are necessary to perform the job, along with the contributions accumulated throughout an employee’s entire career development process at Nexcel.
To make employees’ career paths more specific, measurable, and achievable, the career goals (qualifications, skills, duties, etc.) for some job titles are broken down into more actionable sub-goals, with each represented by the respective job grades.
For some job titles, there are several job grades (A, B, C, D, etc.) The number of job grades will vary depending on the job title. There will be exceptions in which certain job titles do not have job grades.
Job title and job grade promotion will strictly follow the procedures outlined in [Promotion Process](#PromotionProcess).
